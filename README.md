Introduction to open data science
================

After hearing Kimmo Vehkalahti's speech on behalf of this course, I was sure that I really should take this course. My friend recommended this course by calling this course **the best course in University of Helsinki**. I hope that I will learn about **using R and other open softwares for statistical analysis**, since I will need these skills in my studies and career.
